# prometheus-operator-examples

**Disclaimer:** *The configs in this repo should be treated as examples only. This is not tested in production cluster. These examples can serve as a starting point for creating production ready configs.*

For each example config, check README page in respective folder.

## Pre-requisites

Create kind cluster or minikube cluster (examples in this repo are tested with minikube)

```bash
$ minikube delete && minikube start --kubernetes-version=v1.26.5 --memory=6g --bootstrapper=kubeadm --extra-config=kubelet.authentication-token-webhook=true --extra-config=kubelet.authorization-mode=Webhook --extra-config=scheduler.bind-address=0.0.0.0 --extra-config=controller-manager.bind-address=0.0.0.0
```

[kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus#quickstart) stack is configured in cluster before running any examples. Quick start creates a namespace `monitoring` and deploys monitoring components in that. This will help us setup monitoring stack out of the box. 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus.git;
cd kube-prometheus;
kubectl apply --server-side -f manifests/setup
kubectl wait \
	--for condition=Established \
	--all CustomResourceDefinition \
	--namespace=monitoring
kubectl apply -f manifests/
```

You should see following pods after quick start commands are applied (This will take a while for all pods to come up)

```bash

## Helpful Commands

- Access Prometheus UI

  ```bash
  kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-k8s 9090&
  ```

- Access AlertManager UI

  ```bash
  kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/alertmanager-main 9093&
  ```

## Notes

For most of the examples, app deployed is [prometheus-example-app](https://github.com/rhobs/prometheus-example-app). You can deploy a different app adjust configs accordingly (mainly the port number).

Port-forward the app deployed to see more metrices generated by the [prometheus-example-app](https://github.com/rhobs/prometheus-example-app). Otherwise you will see only `version` metric and [automatically generated timeseries](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/#automatically-generated-labels-and-time-series) only in prometheus when you query.

If app is deployed as a pod:

```
kubectl port-forward pod/<pod-name> 8080
```

If service exists/deployed as a Deployment and exposed it through service

```
kubectl port-forward svc/<service-name> 8080
```
